Data.ByteString.Lex.Integral:
    * See how many of the new specializations ({Int,Word}{8,16,32,64}) are actually useful in practice.
    * relax the Integral constraint to Num wherever possible?

./test/:
	* get the test suite to return error codes as appropriate; otherwise TravisCI will always say it works!

./bench/html/:
    * Update the css to match the changes elsewhere
	* set up benchmarking in Cabal

Data.ByteString.Lex.Lazy.*:
    * reintroduce modules for working with lazy bytestrings

README.md:
    * Add coveralls badge? Other stuff from <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtchavez/circleci/master/README.md>
