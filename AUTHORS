Haskell bytestring-lexing package AUTHORS/THANKS file:

The bytestring-lexing package was originally written by Don Stewart
and released under the terms in the LICENSE file. In January 2012
maintainership was taken over by wren ng thornton. I would also
like to give thanks to the following contributers:

Erik de Castro Lopo, and Christoph Breitkopf --- for excessive
    tweaking and benchmarking of the readDecimal function.
