bytestring-lexing
=================

This is a simple package and should be easy to install. You should
be able to use one of the following standard methods to install it.

    -- With cabal-install and without the source:
    $> cabal install bytestring-lexing
    
    -- With cabal-install and with the source already:
    $> cd bytestring-lexing
    $> cabal install
    
    -- Without cabal-install, but with the source already:
    $> cd bytestring-lexing
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs build
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs test
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs haddock --hyperlink-source
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs copy
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs register

The test step is optional and currently does nothing. The Haddock
step is also optional.


Portability
===========

An attempt has been made to keep this library portable. However,
the decimalPrecision function in Data.ByteString.Lex.Fractional
requires ScopedTypeVariables for efficiency. If your compiler does
not support ScopedTypeVariables, this should be easy enough to fix.
Contact the maintainer if this is an issue for you.
