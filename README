bytestring-lexing
=================

This is a relatively simple package and should be easy to install.
It requires Alex for generating the Double lexers. Once that is
installed, you should be able to use one of the following standard
methods to install it.

    -- With cabal-install and without the source:
    $> cabal install bytestring-lexing
    
    -- With cabal-install and with the source already:
    $> cd bytestring-lexing
    $> cabal install
    
    -- Without cabal-install, but with the source already:
    $> cd bytestring-lexing
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs build
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs test
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs haddock --hyperlink-source
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs copy
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs register

The test step is optional and currently does nothing. The Haddock
step is also optional.


Portability
===========

An attempt has been made to keep this library portable. However,
it relies on some language extensions which have been accepted into
the Haskell standard following the Haskell98 report. All the required
language extensions are:

FFI
